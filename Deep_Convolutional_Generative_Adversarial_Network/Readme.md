Hi All,

This is a try to really understand the concept behind the functioning of DCGANs. As it has multiple application, 
I started working on one which is Imaginary concept generation according to the provided input. 
Model preformed really well till 36th Epoch, but after that it looses it main neuron which has its primary feature (might be, my guess, find it on your own)

Thanks to Ian Goodfellow for this beautiful invention.
In this particular model, creating image out of imagination by our DCGANs which is built feeding the set of inputs (true) images.

Dataset: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
(The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.)

Thanks and happy coding.
